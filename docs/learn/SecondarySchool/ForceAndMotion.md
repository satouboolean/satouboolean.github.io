### Equation of unitformly accelerated motion

Assume that a is constant,
$$ s=\frac{1}{2}(u+v)\times t$$
$$ v=u + at$$
$$ s = ut+\frac{1}{2}at^2$$
$$v^2 - u^2 = 2as$$
$g = 9.81 ms^{-2}$ or $g = 10 ms^{-2}$, depends on question provide
※ Remember to identify the direction compare to the motion

### Percenatage Error

$$PercentageError = \frac{T_R}{T_M} \times 100 % $$
where ${T_R}$ is _reaction time_ and ${T_M}$ is _measured time_

### Distance and Displacement

Distance (距離) - Scalars, with no direction
Displacement (位移) - Vectors, with 2 components - magnitude and direction

$$Displacement = Point_{end} - Point_{start}$$

### Speed and Velocity

Speed(速率) - Scalar

$$
Average Speed = \frac{Distance}{Time}
$$

$$
1kmh^{-1} = \frac{1km}{1h} = \frac {1000m}{60\times60s} = \frac{1}{3.6} ms^{-1}
$$

Velocity(速度) - Vector

$$
Average Velocity = \frac{Displacement}{Time}
$$

\*\* Usually use +- to express the direction in secondary school level

When in _Uniform motion_(勻速運動), its assume the velocity of object is constant, So we have $v=\frac{s}{t}$

$\textbf{Slope of displacement-time graph}$ (displacement in y-axis and time in x-axis) = $\textbf{velocity}$ of object

### Acceleration and Deceleration

Acceleration(加速) - Velocity of object increase

$$ AverageAcceleration = \frac{\Delta{Velocity}}{Time} \quad aka\quad a = \frac{v-u}{t} $$

Deceleration(減速) - Velocity of object decrease, and eventually react 0 velocity and reverse the direction of motion

$\textbf{Slope of velocity-time graph}$ (velocity in y-axis and time in x-axis) = $\textbf{accerlation}$ of object
$\textbf{Area under velocity-time graph}$ (velocity in y-axis and time in x-axis) = $\textbf{displacement}$ of object

### Newton's first law of motion

$$\text{''Object will be in uniform motion (stay still or move in constant velocity) if the net force on it is zero''} $$

Net force(淨力) - Resultant force of a object, all force in opposite direction cancel out each other

### Newton's second law of motion

$$
\text{''Accleration of an object is in the same direction as the net force on it.}
$$

$$
\text{ Its directly proportional to the net force and is inversely proportional to the object mass''}
$$

$$ F = ma$$

### Newton's third law of motion

$$
\text{ ''To every action, there is an equal but opposite reaction force''}
$$

tl:dr - 作用力與反作用力

### Inertia(慣性)

Tendency of object to remain in original motion, depends on its mass

### friction (摩擦力)

1. Friction happen when object have a non-zero net force $F_{net}$, and the object tries to move along the contacted surface because of $F_{net}$. Noted that $F_{net}$ is not the final resultant force, it is the resultant force without taking friction in count
2. Friction magnitude in range $ 0< f < f\_{max}$, depends on the net force magnitude, if $ F_{net} > f_{max}$, object move with the new net force $F = F_{net} - f_{max}$

E.g Free falling(自由落體) - Object is falling due to gravity $F_{net} = Weight = mg$, and the air resistance _f_ is increased when the velocity increases. At one point, the object reach a velocity that _f_ completely cancel out the weight, making $F_{net} = mg - f = 0$, and the object reach its constant velocity in free falling, which called $\textbf{terminal velocity}$

### moment (力矩)

Object in state of balance when the sum of clockwise momoent is equal to sum of anti-clockwise moment.
$ m_1g \times d_1 = m_2g \times d_2$, where $d_1$ and $d_2$ is the distance between the force and pivot point

### Equilibrium(平衡)

Object in state of equilibrium when

- Net force on it is zero
- Net moment on it is zero

### Free-body diagram(隔離體圖)

W = Weight(重量) - $Mass \times gravity$ or $m\times g$
R = Normal reaction force(法向反作用力)
